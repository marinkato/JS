    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // age2 = age;
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);//its 200, 100 because the value of age goes into the variable at the same time - its works the same with strings

    // let name = 'Marina';
    // let name2 = name;
    // let name = 'Marinkako'
    // console.log(name, name2);//its Marinkato, Marina - if you change the original one it will not update the other one

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // Lux gets printed both in team an players, because the team is refering to players (unlike the case with case, numbers and booleans) the problem - we have edited the original array too!
    // Because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); //usually you pass 2 arguments when using slice, but if we dont do that we will make a copy of an array
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team[3] = 'Niko';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects - same thing happens
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80;
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 78;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const inhabitant = {
      name: 'marina';
